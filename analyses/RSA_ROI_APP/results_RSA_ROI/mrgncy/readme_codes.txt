RSA_flavours:

OEPM = one_ev_per_movie (56 predictors)
EHLP = emotion_high_low_predictors (14 predictors)
EP   = emotion_predictors (7 predictors)

For each of the ones above, two additional options are possible:

MN   = copes obtained by subtracting neutral from an emotion movie cope 

RM   = not considering neutral copes in the RSA
