**THIS IS THE SAME CODE AS IN do_RSA_V[N].Rmd HOWEVER SINCE HERE WE HAVE DEFINED
ONE PREDICTOR FOR *ALL* MOVIES WITH THE SAME EMOTION, WE NEED TO CALCULATE
THE RATING FOR EACH EMOTION AS THE AVG (MEDIAN) RATING FOR EACH EMOTION MOVIE
FOR EACH SUB**

this part is implemented directly in `do_RSA_emotion_predictors_V[N].Rmd`

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

bd="/data00/leonardo/RSA/analyses/rsa_emotion_predictors"
```

Read the original ratings file
```{r, message=FALSE}
bd_ratings = paste0(bd,"/RATINGS")
ratings_type <- "emotion"

ratings_path <- paste0(bd_ratings,"/",ratings_type,"_ratings.csv")
rats <- read_csv(ratings_path)
```


```{r}
rats %>% 
  select(sub, emotion, starts_with("r_")) %>%
  group_by(sub, emotion) %>% 
  reframe(across(starts_with("r_"), median, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ungroup %>% 
  arrange(sub, emotion)
```
